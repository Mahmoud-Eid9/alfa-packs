## Quality
---
It is an ongoing process to detect, reduce or eliminate errors in the manufacturing process,
streamline supply chain management, improve customer experience, and ensure
employees are up to speed. We have a system for recording, controlling and improving
production, procurement, sales, warehousing, training, receiving and following up
customer complaints. Any known and recorded production, the type of paper, bags and
cartons used, their source, the date they were entered into the factory, and the names of the
workers who participated in their production.
We perform quality control every hour. If we detect a defect, then all products produced
since the last successful test are rejected. Thus, a possibility of delivering a faulty product
to a customer is reduced to zero.
