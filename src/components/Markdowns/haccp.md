## Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP)
---
The company has established a HACCP program which includes:
*	Conducting a risk analysis for all operations and products.
*	Identifying critical points for each operation and product.
*	Developing corrective actions to be taken in case of non-compliance with critical points.
*	Providing employee training on HACCP procedures.
*	Establishing an annual self-revision plan for HACCP.
*	Ensuring critical points are controlled and employees are aware of them and take appropriate corrective actions.


These measures help identify possible contamination during various stages of manufacture and ensure that the final product is hygienic. By being able to intervene at each critical point, the company can take necessary corrective actions to prevent contamination and damage to products.
Moreover, the establishment of an annual self-revision program helps ensure that critical points on the production line remain valid and effective.

Overall, the implementation of HACCP provides a comprehensive approach to food safety and quality management. It involves identifying potential hazards and taking measures to prevent them from occurring, resulting in a safe and high-quality product.
