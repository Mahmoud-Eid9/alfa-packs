## Food Safe (ISO 22000)
---
As a food packaging factory, Alpha Pack understands the importance of safe and reliable packaging. That’s why we use high-quality materials that are specifically designed to be food safe and implement strict quality control measures throughout our production process. Our paper cups and containers are regularly tested to ensure they meet necessary safety standards.
To demonstrate our commitment to food safety, we’ve obtained the ISO 22000 certification, a globally recognized standard that evaluates a company’s food safety management systems. This certification ensures that our products are of high quality and meet all relevant legal and regulatory requirements of food safe practice.
And because we put export as one of our most important goals, the Egyptian Food Safety Authority visits the factory periodically and takes samples of the products to analyze them and ensure their food safe  grade.
By prioritizing food safety and quality, we’ve earned the trust of our customers, who can rely on our products to transport and store their food safely without the risk of contamination.
