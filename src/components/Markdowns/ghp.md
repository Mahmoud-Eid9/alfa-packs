Alfa Pack takes pride in maintaining the highest standards of hygiene in our operations. We have a clean and orderly workspace, and a protocol for cleaning and disinfecting our equipment and machinery regularly. Workers are trained in good hygiene practices, emphasizing the importance of maintaining personal hygiene and avoiding contamination of our products. Workers have special clothing and tools to ensure that cross-contamination is prevented, such as gauntlets, head coverings, and masks
